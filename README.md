# Lab02
This week you’ll be using the NodeMCU ESP-12E to control a propeller attached to a DC motor. Specifically, you’ll be interfacing the NodeMCU with an L293D H-bridge motor driver chip, and the L293D will actually control the motor. The propeller, motor, and L293D are all part of the “Super Kit for Arduino” from SUNFOUNDER (www.sunfounder.com).

You have three turn-ins for this lab. The lab handout with answered questions, a schematic of your motor control circuit (attached to the lab handout), and your program (saved to this assignment repo).

Enjoy!
